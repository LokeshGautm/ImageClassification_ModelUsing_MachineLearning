# ImageClassification_ModelUsing_MachineLearning
Image classification model using machine leanring is a integration of two models MobileNetV2 and CIFAR-10 for image classification and Streamlit is used for Graphical User Interface. In this model user can upload images and get the prediction of there images with the accuracy percentags.

## How to Use
**Step 1**: Clone the repo.

**Step 2**: Create the virtual environment using -
<br>
*python -m venv venv*
<br>
*.venv\Scripts\activate*

**Step 3**: Use pip to install Requirements -
<br>
*Streamlit*
<br>
*tensorflow*
<br>
*matplotlip*
<br>
*numpy*

**Step 4**: To Star Streamlit application use -
<br>
*streamlit run app.py*

**Step 5**: Select the Model from the nevigation.

**Step 6**: Upload the Image and get the result of your work.

**NOTE**-: Tensorflow support only Python 3.8 ot 3.11 version of python right now.
